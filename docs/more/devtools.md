# Devtools

The `@fibbojs/devtools` package provides a debugging tool for your Fibbo scenes.

For now, it only enable displaying and editing the scene's components on a custom GUI. However any changes made to the components will not be saved in your source code.

If you're using the starter, the devtools are already included in the project. They should be visible in development mode, but disabled in production.

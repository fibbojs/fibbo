# Upgrading

Fibbo still has no dedicated CLI for migrating to newer versions. However, you can manually upgrade your project by installing the latest versions of the packages you are using.

## Upgrading a 2D project

```bash
npm install @fibbojs/core@latest @fibbojs/2d@latest @fibbojs/event@latest @fibbojs/devtools@latest
```

## Upgrading a 3D project

```bash
npm install @fibbojs/core@latest @fibbojs/3d@latest @fibbojs/event@latest @fibbojs/devtools@latest
```

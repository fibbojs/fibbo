# Installation

Want to create a new game ? Fibbo provides a starter project based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for both 2D and 3D games. It includes a basic scene as well as devtools to help you get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) : for now, Fibbo was only tested with [Node.js 22.2.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v22.2.0/), but it should work with any other versions as it is mainly a frontend technology.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) : should be included with Node.js

## New 2D game

- Clone the [starter project](https://github.com/fibbojs/starter-2d) from the repository
```bash
npx tiged fibbojs/starter-2d my-new-game
```
- Install the dependencies
```bash
cd my-new-game
npm install
```
- Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## New 3D game

- Clone the [starter project](https://github.com/fibbojs/starter-3d) from the repository
```bash
npx tiged fibbojs/starter-3d my-new-game
```
- Install the dependencies
```bash
cd my-new-game
npm install
```

# Installation

Want to create a new game ? Fibbo provides an easy way to clone a starter project to get you started quickly.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) : for now, Fibbo was only tested with [Node.js 22.2.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v22.2.0/), but it should work with any other versions as it is mainly a frontend technology.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) : should be included with Node.js

## Quick start

```bash [2d]
npm create fibbo@latest -t 2d

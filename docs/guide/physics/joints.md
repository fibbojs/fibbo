# Joints <Badge type="warning" text="work in progress" />

As joints are still not supported natively in Fibbo, you should use the underlying libraries to create and manage joints in your scene.

You can check the [Rapier documentation](https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/javascript/joints) to learn more about how to manage joints in Rapier.

# Lights

As lights are still not supported natively in Fibbo, you should still use the underlying libraries to create and manage lights in your scene.

By default, the 2D starter does not include any kind of light, and the 3D starter includes a basic [AmbientLight](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/AmbientLight).

To learn more about how to manage lights in Three.js, you can check the [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/manual/#en/lights).

We are planning to add a light system in Fibbo in the future, but for now, you should use the underlying libraries directly.

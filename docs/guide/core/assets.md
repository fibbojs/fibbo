# Assets

Assets are files that are included in the final build of your application. They can be sprites or 3D models that you want to include in your application.

Fibbo considers assets are located in the `assets` path of your project. If you're using the starter template (based on Vite), you should put your assets in the `public/assets` folder.

## Where can I find assets ?

Here are some websites where you can find free assets for your projects :

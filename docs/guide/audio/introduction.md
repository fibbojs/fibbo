# Audio <Badge type="warning" text="work in progress" />

Audio is still not supported natively in Fibbo, so for now, you should consider using third-party libraries to manage audio in your Fibbo application.

Here are some libraries that you can use to manage audio on the web :

- [Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js)
- [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js)
- [Pizzicato.js](https://github.com/alemangui/pizzicato)

You can find more libraries on the [awesome-audio](https://github.com/notthetup/awesome-webaudio) list.
